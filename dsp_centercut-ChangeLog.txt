1.4.0 (2007-Jul-19):
  * Option to put bass in side channels, useful if your goal is vocal removal.
  * Improved workaround for Winamp's threading bugs.

1.3.2 (2006-Jul-14):
  * Another quality tweak.

1.3.1 (2006-Jul-12):
  * Fixed classic vocal remover which was broken in the previous version.

1.3.0 (2006-Jul-12):
  * Algorithm enhancement to improve quality (clicking problem is eliminated,
    echo is significantly reduced).
  * Rewrote a lot of inefficient code (it runs over twice as fast now).

1.2.0 (2004-Mar-30):
  * Output is now buffered, which allows larger FHT sizes to be used.
  * Default FHT size is now 8192, this will reduce warbling but add some slight
    echo.

1.1.0 (2004-Jan-19):
  * Added a workaround for the crash bug when switching between options (this
    is actually a problem with Winamp unloading the DLL too early).
  * Now supports 8/16/24/32 bit audio (only did 16 bit before).
  * Code cleanup.

1.0.0 (2004-Jan-11):
  * First release.
