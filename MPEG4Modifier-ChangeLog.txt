1.4.5 (2012-Sep-02):
  * Ability to export custom quantization matrix to .cqm file.
  * Fixed window layout with high DPI settings.
  * Supports loading on .NET 4.x runtime (not required; still 2.0 compatible).
1.4.4 (2007-Jan-13):
  * Fixed a few small issues that prevented DivX subtitles from working.
  * Added *.divx to the supported extension list in the file dialogs.
  * A default file name is now provided when saving.
1.4.3 (2006-Nov-05):
  * Doesn't remove delay frames anymore, this caused synch problems with joined
    videos.
  * FourCC and user data information are now shown in the "Video Info" text.
  * It's now possible to pack videos containing drop frames.
1.4.2 (2006-Sep-16):
  * Fixed several problems with OpenDML reading/writing (writing bad OpenDML
    index entries, out of memory exception or unnecessary reading when loading,
    incomplete loading of files with damaged/missing index).
1.4.1 (2006-Aug-04):
  * Fixed some problems with packing which also required corrections to the
    timestamp calculation code.
  * If you try to load a non-MPEG4 video, the error message now displays which
    codec the file uses.
  * Better default directories for load/save file dialogs.
1.4.0 (2006-Aug-03):
  * AVI handling code completely rewritten, supports OpenDML and incomplete
    files (rebuilds the index including keyframe flags).
  * Ability to add/readd packed bitstream.
  * Optimized some parts, runs significantly faster.
  * Added Cancel button on load/save progress window.
  * Doesn't freeze explorer while loading a file after dropping onto the source
    textbox.
  * Updated code to take advantage of C# 2.0 features, and lots of cleanup.
1.3.4 (2005-Dec-14):
  * Re-added support for files with packed bitstream containing real N-VOPs
    (apparently the XviD 1.1 betas do this).
1.3.3 (2005-Dec-11):
  * Fixed bug when unpacking files with missing N-VOPs (caused by cutting/
    joining).
  * Removed support for files with packed bitstream containing real N-VOPs to
    simplify code.
1.3.2 (2005-Mar-08):
  * New feature: Video Info now shows how many warp points are actually used
    (for example, DivX indicates 2 warp points in the VOL, but the 2nd one is
    never used).
  * Added detection for corrupt RIFF chunk sizes.
  * Fixed byte order problem in AVI index on big endian systems (for command
    line unpacker running on OS X).
1.3.1 (2005-Jan-06):
  * Added percent in titlebar of progress window.
  * Added 1.85:1 display aspect ratio.
  * Fixed saving AVIs with no index.
  * Fixed small cosmetic issues in main window.
1.3.0 (2004-Dec-20):
  * New feature: option to automatically change user data when unpacking.
  * Fixed bugs with 'rec ' list indexing.
  * Added progress bar during load and save.
  * A file can be loaded from the command line, or by dropping it on the AVI
    Source text box.
  * Error checking is less strict (no more "No dummy N-VOP found for packed
    frame" and "Invalid VOL" errors).
  * Files are closed sooner, and output file is deleted if an error occurs
    during save.
  * Other code improvements and clean-up.
1.2.0 (2004-Sep-14):
  * New feature: modification of field order for interlaced videos.
  * New feature: video information (i.e. whether or not QPel/GMC were used,
    stats for how many I/B/P/S/N-VOPs were used, list of VOP type and
    timestamp for each frame, etc.).
  * Packed bitstream removal can now tell the difference between dummy N-VOPs
    and real N-VOPs.
1.1.0 (2004-Jun-24):
  * New feature: packed bitstream removal.
  * New feature: userdata modification.
  * Recognizes frames written in '00db' chunks.
1.0.0 (2004-Jun-14):
  * Has a proper GUI.
  * Warns if the AVI is OpenDML.
  * Reads the frame width/height from the video (for DAR->PAR calculation).
  * Writes dwSuggestedBufferSize in the video stream header (it wrote 0
    before).
  * Supports 'rec ' lists.
  * Code has been restructured.
